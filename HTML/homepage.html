            <p>Spider-Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by
                writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing
                Fantasy
                #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He has since been featured in films, television
                shows,
                video games, and plays. Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker, an orphan raised by his Aunt May and
                Uncle
                Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker died in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had
                the
                character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues and gave him many supporting
                characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry Osborn; romantic interests Gwen Stacy,
                Mary
                Jane Watson, and the Black Cat; and foes such as Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin, and Venom. In his
                origin
                story, he gets spider-related abilities from a bite from a radioactive spider; these include clinging to
                surfaces, superhuman strength and agility, and detecting danger with his "spider-sense." He also builds
                wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial spider webs of his own design.

            <p>When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually
                relegated to the role of sidekick to the protagonist. The Spider-Man series broke ground by featuring
                Peter Parker, a high school student from Queens, New York, as Spider-Man's secret identity, whose
                "self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness" were issues to which young readers could
                relate.[8] While Spider-Man had all the makings of a sidekick, unlike previous teen heroes such as Bucky
                and Robin, Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like Captain America and Batman; he thus had to learn for
                himself that "with great power there must also come great responsibility"—a line included in a text box
                in the final panel of the first Spider-Man story but later retroactively attributed to his guardian, his
                late Uncle Ben Parker.

                Marvel has featured Spider-Man in several comic book series, the first and longest-lasting of which is
                The Amazing Spider-Man. Over the years, the Peter Parker character developed from a shy, nerdy New York
                City high school student to troubled but outgoing college student, to married high school teacher to, in
                the late 2000s, a single freelance photographer. In the 2000s, he joins the Avengers. Doctor Octopus
                also took on the identity for a story arc spanning 2012–2014, following a body swap plot in which Peter
                appears to die.[9] Marvel has also published books featuring alternate versions of Spider-Man, including
                Spider-Man 2099, which features the adventures of Miguel O'Hara, the Spider-Man of the future; Ultimate
                Spider-Man, which features the adventures of a teenaged Peter Parker in an alternate universe; and
                Ultimate Comics Spider-Man, which depicts the teenager Miles Morales, who takes up the mantle of
                Spider-Man after Ultimate Peter Parker's supposed death. Miles later became a popular superhero in his
                own right, and was brought into the mainstream continuity, where he sometimes works alongside Peter.

            <br>
            <p>In 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and head writer Stan Lee was
                casting about for a new superhero idea. He said the idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage
                demand for comic books, and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify.[15]: 1  As
                with Fantastic Four, Lee saw Spider-Man as an opportunity to "get out of his system" what he felt was
                missing in comic books.[16] In his autobiography, Lee cites the non-superhuman pulp magazine crime
                fighter the Spider as a great influence,[14]: 130  and in a multitude of print and video interviews, Lee
                stated he was further inspired by seeing a spider climb up a wall—adding in his autobiography that he
                has told that story so often he has become unsure of whether or not this is true.[note 1][page needed]
                Although at the time teenage superheroes were usually given names ending with "boy", Lee says he chose
                "Spider-Man" because he wanted the character to age as the series progressed, and moreover felt the name
                "Spider-Boy" would have made the character sound inferior to other superheroes.[17] He also decided to
                insert a hyphen in the name, as he felt it looked too similar to Superman, another superhero with a red
                and blue costume which starts with an "S" and ends with "man"[18] (although artist Steve Ditko intended
                the character to have an orange and purple costume).[19] At that time Lee had to get only the consent of
                Marvel publisher Martin Goodman for the character's approval. In a 1986 interview, Lee described in
                detail his arguments to overcome Goodman's objections.[note 2] Goodman eventually agreed to a Spider-Man
                tryout in what Lee in numerous interviews recalled as what would be the final issue of the
                science-fiction and supernatural anthology series Amazing Adult Fantasy, which was renamed Amazing
                Fantasy for that single issue, #15 (cover-dated August 1962, on sale June 5, 1962).[20] In particular,
                Lee stated that the fact that it had already been decided that Amazing Fantasy would be canceled after
                issue #15 was the only reason Goodman allowed him to use Spider-Man.[17] While this was indeed the final
                issue, its editorial page anticipated the comic continuing and that "The Spiderman [sic] ... will appear
                every month in Amazing."[20][21]
                <br><br>
                Regardless, Lee received Goodman's approval for the name Spider-Man and the "ordinary teen" concept and
                approached artist Jack Kirby. As comics historian Greg Theakston recounts, Kirby told Lee about an
                unpublished character on which he had collaborated with Joe Simon in the 1950s, in which an orphaned boy
                living with an old couple finds a magic ring that granted him superhuman powers. Lee and Kirby
                "immediately sat down for a story conference", Theakston writes, and Lee afterward directed Kirby to
                flesh out the character and draw some pages.[22] Steve Ditko would be the inker.[note 3] When Kirby
                showed Lee the first six pages, Lee recalled, "I hated the way he was doing it! Not that he did it
                badly—it just wasn't the character I wanted; it was too heroic".[22]: 12  Lee turned to Ditko, who
                developed a visual style Lee found satisfactory. Ditko recalled:
                <br><br>
                One of the first things I did was to work up a costume. A vital, visual part of the character. I had to
                know how he looked ... before I did any breakdowns. For example: A clinging power so he wouldn't have
                hard shoes or boots, a hidden wrist-shooter versus a web gun and holster, etc. ... I wasn't sure Stan
                would like the idea of covering the character's face but I did it because it hid an obviously boyish
                face. It would also add mystery to the character....[23]
